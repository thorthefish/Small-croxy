A full day of CAD. Got the design mostly finalized, just need to get final electronics list and bed system then I can submit. There wasnt much trouble, nothing fancy but also a pretty good amount of progress for one days work.

The budget for this will be a bit tight, but with liberal applications of printed parts it will be managable, so the BOM doesnt need a ton of work after this.

Project pitched in slack, so maybe i can get stuff ordered this week
