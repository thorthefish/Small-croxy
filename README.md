This project is a cross gantry 3d printer, that uses a mostly 3d printed frame. It is a very useful tool for prototyping, due to its low cost compared to other costom 3d printers, especialy other cross gantry design, which are usualy $1200 minimum. Another fun part about it is the insane acceleration and speeds that are accesable through the dual motors and direct drive system.

# Why

I decided to build and design this particular project because of the hypercube overkill project on Reprap https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?177,807843, and after I saw the forum post for the first time about a year ago, I havnt been able to get it out of my head. I love the benefits of cross gantry designs and they are one of the fastest possible kinematic syatems of printers, but due to their cost,I have never been able to consider building one, so I decided to make a cross gantry design for as little as possible to prove that the high pricetag was not nesicary to get into this particular design.

Also I just wanted a  fun first printer project.
